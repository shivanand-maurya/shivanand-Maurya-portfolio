## It's a Marathon, Not a Sprint

Many people start their fitness journey with high intensity, only to burn out after a few weeks. The key to long-term success is consistency. 

## Small Steps, Big Results

Instead of trying to do too much too soon, focus on making small, sustainable changes to your daily routine. Even 30 minutes of exercise per day can make a huge difference over time.

Consistency builds momentum and helps you create lasting habits. So, show up every day, even if it's just for a short workout. Your future self will thank you.
